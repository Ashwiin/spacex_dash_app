Build a Dashboard Application with Plotly Dash
In this lab, you will be building a Plotly Dash application for users to perform interactive visual analytics on SpaceX launch data in real-time.

This dashboard application contains input components such as a dropdown list and a range slider to interact with a pie chart and a scatter point chart. You will be guided to build this dashboard application via the following tasks:

TASK 1: Add a Launch Site Drop-down Input Component
TASK 2: Add a callback function to render success-pie-chart based on selected site dropdown
TASK 3: Add a Range Slider to Select Payload
TASK 4: Add a callback function to render the success-payload-scatter-chart scatter plot
Note:Please take screenshots of the Dashboard and save them. Further upload your notebook to github.

The github url and the screenshots are later required in the presentation slides.

Your completed dashboard application should look like the following screenshot:



After visual analysis using the dashboard, you should be able to obtain some insights to answer the following five questions:

- Which site has the largest successful launches?
- Which site has the highest launch success rate?
- Which payload range(s) has the highest launch success rate?
- Which payload range(s) has the lowest launch success rate?
- Which F9 Booster version (v1.0, v1.1, FT, B4, B5, etc.) has the highest
launch success rate?
